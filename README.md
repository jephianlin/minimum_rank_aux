================
auxiliary tools for the minimum rank problem

Run the code below:

```Python
load("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jephianlin/minrank_aux/master/load_all.py")
load_all()
```

If you are using CoCalc or there is problem loading the libraries from the internet.  You may download the two repositories below by clicking **Clone or download** and **Download ZIP**.

- [mr_JG](https://github.com/jephianlin/mr_JG)
- [minrank_aux](https://github.com/jephianlin/minrank_aux)

Upload the two zip files to CoCalc and put them in the folder where your Jupyter notebook (or *.sagews) is.  Unzip the files so that your folder looks like

    my_project.ipynb
    mr_JG-master/
    minrank_aux-master/    

Now run the code below in your Jupyter notebook.

```Python
load("minrank_aux-master/load_all.py")
load_all(local=True)
```
